WatchSimKit will let you take an existing WatchKit app and display it inside an iPhone app. 

The displayed app will be fully interactive, and you can test things like tap targets and interface sizing.

Currently, only a subset of the WatchKit Interface controls are available, including:
- Labels
- Buttons
- Groups
- Images
- Separators

Some of these may not display with 100% fidelity.

Note: to build the Sample, you'll need to first build the Combined target of the main project.
